### Summary
A drawback with how this page is set up with the filtering would be knowing in which parameters to use to filter out the data. The user would have to look at the data entirely to find out what parametr can be applied.
A drop down list could help set up parameters for the user.
Also, a clear button would help instead of clicking UFO sightings at the top left of the webpage.
